# Weather

The app follows MVVM architecture.

* Dagger is used for dependency injection.
* RxJava is used to make the app Asynchronous.
* The app always first checks the local database for data and then proceeds to download from web as necessary.


Given more time,

* I would have concentrated on the UI more - making it look pretty with animated weather icons and such.
* I could have used some Senior developer's guidance to make it even more streamlined. There were some times during coding this where I felt like things were an afterthought.
